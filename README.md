#TheRegalRavens
The project Best Price best Recipe solves the below 4 problems.
1.What meal to cook? 
2. What ingredients make up the final dish? 
3. How much do these ingredients cost? 
4. Step by Step guide on how to cook the dish at hand?

The above problems are solved as below.
1.	Based on the ingredient the user has and searches for, the app returns top 3 recipes along with ingredients, image and video link from meal DB API
2.	The list of ingredients gives the user an idea what goes into the recipe and helps plan which recipe to choose based on the ingredients he already have or has to buy.
3.	Then the ingredients obtained from the meal DB API for each recipe are passed to Walmart API to retrieve prices. The prices will help the user make a decision which recipe to go for base don price of the ingredients he has to buy.
4.	The images are hyperlinks to videos which show step by step process to cook the recipe. The video opens in YouTube in a different window ensuring all the recipe details are intact on the main page.
